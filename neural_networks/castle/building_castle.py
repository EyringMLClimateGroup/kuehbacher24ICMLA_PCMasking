    Builds and compiles a neural network with CASTLE (Causal Structure Learning) regularization
    from Kyono et al. 2020. CASTLE: Regularization via Auxiliary Causal Graph Discovery.
    https://doi.org/10/grw6pt.

    The output of the model is an array of shape [num_inputs + 1, batch_size, 1].
    The first element of the output (output[0]) contains the prediction for the target variable y.

    Args:
        num_inputs (int): The number of predictors, i.e. the x-variables. This is also the number of neural network
            inputs for all input sub-layers.
        hidden_layers (list of int): A list containing the hidden units for all hidden layers.
            ``len(hidden_layers)`` gives the number of hidden layers.
        activation (str, case insensitive): A string specifying the activation function,
            e.g. `relu`, `linear`, `sigmoid`, `tanh`. In addition to tf.keras specific strings for
            built-in activation functions, `LeakyReLU` can be used to specify leaky ReLU activation function.
            See also https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Activation.
        rho (float): Penalty parameter for Lagrangian optimization scheme for acyclicity constraint.
            `rho` must be greater than 0.
        alpha (float): Lagrangian multiplier for Lagrangian optimization scheme for acyclicity constraint.
        lambda_weight (float): Weighting coefficient for the regularization term in the training loss.
        learning_rate (float): Optimizer learning rate: Defaults to 0.001.
        eager_execution (bool): If `True`, the code will be executed eagerly and the model's logic will
            not be wrapped inside a tf.function. Can be used for debugging purposes. Defaults to `False`.
        strategy (tf.distribute.Strategy): State and compute distribution policy for parallelization
            across GPUs and/or SLURM nodes.
        seed (int): Random seed. Used to make the behavior of the initializer deterministic.
            Note that a seeded initializer will produce the same random values across multiple calls.

    Returns:
        tf.keras.Model: A tf.keras model designed according to CASTLE architecture.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If `rho` is not greater than 0.

# The purpose of these tests is to see whether the training loss is still a number,
# when we have a full network with 94 inputs and 1 outputs. They are separate from normal training tests
# in order to speed up those tests.
#
# Possible options for reducing the training loss:
#  - reduce initial weights
#  - reduce learning rate
#  - adam options: weight decay, clip norm, clip value
